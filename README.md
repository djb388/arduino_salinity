# arduino_salinity
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the amount of distilled water hydrated SAP beads (http://www.hometrainingtools.com/a/water-beads-superabsorbent-polymer-science) leech over time when exposed to various concentrations of saline solutions. Specifically, it is intended to automate all aspects of the experiment with minimal user input.

The device we built dumps a measured amount of hydrated SAP beads and pumps a measured amount of saline solution into a bucket, taking salinity measurements for 10 minutes.
