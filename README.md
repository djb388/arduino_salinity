# arduino_salinity
Device dumps a measured amount of hydrated SAP beads and pumps a measured amount of saline solution into a bucket, taking salinity measurements for 10 minutes.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the amount of distilled water hydrated SAP beads (http://www.hometrainingtools.com/a/water-beads-superabsorbent-polymer-science) leech over time when exposed to various concentrations of saline solutions.
